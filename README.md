CommSim
=======

Communications Network Simulation

This project is designed to be capable of simulating a communications network under dynamic conditions, including
inclement weather, wireless signal degradation and interference, and contact loss. All scripts are MATLAB scripts, but
will eventually be adapted for Qc and D-based applications.

Usage
=====

All files required for the simulation are available as a standard MATLAB package folder, labeled '+CommSim'. This is to
allow end users easy access to the simulation. Make sure the +CommSim folder is on your MATLAB path, and you will have
access to all simulation functionality.

Notes
=====

THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY IN STAGE-I DEVELOPMENT!!

All functionality is still in development, and will be changing drastically over the course of its development cycle. Do
not rely on simulations to be accurate, if they even work. When the project moves into Stage-II Development, basic functions
will be operable, and simulation results may be considered useful. However, there will still be major changes to the project,
including implementation of further dynamic elements.
